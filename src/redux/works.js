* <h1>An e-commerce site for mostly digital sale</h1>
                <p>This is a functional e-commerce site. Except some parts of the site such as checkout page, I used a frontend package as my frontend. So I
                    didn't code much of a frontend. This project is my first longterm project due to it's database model and backend. By the way, as longterm, I
                    mean 1 or 2 months. This site really helped me to learn the basics of <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong>. So I appreciate that.
                    It is also connected to the <i>Admin Panel</i>, I recommend that you check that out too.</p>
                <p>Here's all you need to login as a user:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>User email · <span>deneme@deneme.com</span></li>
                    <li>User password · <span>123</span></li>
                    <li>And of course, the link · <a target="_blank" class="link-grey" href="https://satis.emirhakan.com">satis.emirhakan.com</a></li>
